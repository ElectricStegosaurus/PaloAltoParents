===========
Unix Basics
===========
man <topic>	Display the manual page on a topic
man -k <word>	Do a keyword search of all the man pages.
which <command>	Print path of a given command
type <command>	Similar to which; more correct than which
		  NOTE: if you have "export NOVICE" in your .profile,
			type is aliased to something else.  You should
			remove "export NOVICE" and relogin or use
			"\type" to access this command


=================
Filesystem Basics
=================
pwd		Print working directory
cd <dir>	Change working directory
ls [-lA]	List files in working directory
		  -l means print in wide format (shows permissions etc.)
		  -A means print hidden files (those that start with .)
mv <src> <dst>	Move and/or Rename file (you must specify both)
cp <src> <dst>	Copy file from src to dst (you must specify both)
rm <file>	Remove (delete) a file
		  Recursive:
		  rm and cp support a -R option to remove or copy all
		  files within a directory, if the target is a directory
touch <file>	  Create an empty file or change modification time
ln -s <src> [<dst>]
		Make a symbolic link to <src> named <dst>

Directory Basics
----------------
mkdir <file>	Make a directory
rmdir <file>	Remove a directory (must be non-empty)

Special Directories
-------------------
~		Your home directory
~<userid>	That user's home directory e.g. ~djv = David's home directory
.  (period)	The current working directory (useful for commands like cp)
.. (2xperiod)	One level up the directory hierarchy from the working directory
		  e.g. if the working directory is "/p/ui/",
		       then ".." represents "/p/".

Permissions
-----------
chmod [-R] <mode> <files>
		Change permissions on <files> to <mode>.  -R means
		  recursive (see above, at rm)
chgrp [-R] <group> <files>
		Change groups on <files> to <group>.  -R means recursive.

File Recovery
-------------
cd .snapshot	Go to directory of backup directories ("snapshots")
		  (a cunix peculiarity)


============
Shell Basics
============

Environment
-----------
export		List all environment settings
echo $DISPLAY	Display the value of environment variable DISPLAY
export DISPLAY=muddsun72.cc.columbia.edu:0.0
		Export your display environment variable to muddsun72
xhost +		Allow an exported display to appear on your computer
alias		View or change shell aliases
		  (e.g. type "alias rm='rm -i'" to always prompt before rm)

Command-Line Fun
----------------
<Tab>		Expand this filename if possible

|		Pipe output from one command to another
>		Redirect Standard Output to file
			e.g. cat foo > foo_bar
<		Redirect Standard Input from file
>&		Redirect Standard Output and Standard Error


===========
User Basics
===========
groups <user>	Show what groups <user> is in
group		Command for creating/viewing groups
		  (a cunix peculiarity)
pages -v <user>	Show a user's print quota and history
me <user>	Show account information about a user


==============
Process Basics
==============
ps -u <user>	List processes (running programs) owned by user
sps		Like ps; a little prettier
top		List top processes running on a machine (heaviest load)
jobs		List jobs (jobs are like processes)
fg		Put active job in the foreground (blocks command-line)
bg		Put active job in the background (runs at same time as shell)
kill -9 <pid>	Kill a process.  <pid> is the process id as found with ps.
		  [There are a variety of other signals you can send...  Try
		   'man -s 5 signal' for more.]
control-C	Try to kill a process (works sometimes, not others).
control-Z	Stop (suspend) a process.  Use fg or bg to bring it back.













=============
Editor Basics
=============
pico -z		Runs the pico text editor (with suspend enabled)
emacs		Runs everyone's favorite text editor
stty <function> <character>
		Remap a function to a character...
		  e.g. 'stty erase ^H' might make the delete key work...
pine -z		Runs pine (everyone's favorite mail program)
		  (with suspend enabled)
cat		Dump a (text) file to the standard output (i.e. screen)
		  Useful with redirection to concatenate files.
		  e.g. 'cat foo1.ps foo2.ps > fooall.ps' -- it really works :)
more		Everyone's favorite program for displaying text files...
		  can view page-by-page, search, etc.
		  (Try these commands: <space>, b, /<search_string>)
less		A fancier text viewing program
vi		The text editor that puts the 'vi' in 'evil'.

==============
Network Basics
==============
telnet <host>	Use to log into another computer to use it
rlogin <host>	Remote login to <host>
ftp <host>	Use to log into another computer to transfer files
ssh <host>	'Secure Shell' -- encrypted login, the only safe way to
		  use the internet (I think)
ping <host>	See if a computer is alive or down.
nslookup <host>	Look up a host or ip address
rsh <host> <command>
		Run <command> on <host>
onall <command>	Run <command> on all cunix hosts
rup		Check loads on all cunix hosts

==========
Unix Tools
==========
grep <string> <file>
		Search for string in file; print all lines where there's
		  a match
diff <file1> <file2>
		Compare two files and print out the differences, line-by-line
gcc <file>	Compile c/c++ source code file <file>
javac <file>	Compile java source code file <file>
gzip <file>	Compress <file> ('gunzip <file>' decompresses)		
tar cvf <dst> <src1> <src2> ...
		Concatenate files <src1> and <src2> ... into file <dst>
		  (To separate, use 'tar xvf <src>')
gv <file>	Open postscript file for viewing
acroread <file>	Open pdf file in Adobe Acrobat Reader
